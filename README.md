# Livewire v4 Learning Journey

Welcome to my Livewire v4 learning project! 🎉

## About
This repository is a sandbox where I am exploring and learning the features of [Livewire v4](https://livewire.laravel.com/). Livewire, created by Caleb Porzio, is a full-stack framework for Laravel that simplifies building dynamic and interactive interfaces.

## Goals
- Understand the basics of Livewire components.
- Learn how to handle state and events.
- Explore Livewire's lifecycle hooks.
- Experiment with real-time updates and interactivity.

## Progress
Follow along as I document my progress and share insights from the [Laracasts Livewire v4 series](https://laracasts.com/series/everything-new-in-livewire-4/), created by Caleb Porzio himself.
